# Letter of Credit Flow Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation demonstrates a complete end-to-end Letter of Credit (LC) flow system using Zustand for state management with localStorage persistence. The system connects four different user dashboards that work together to manage the complete LC lifecycle.

## Architecture

### State Management
- **Zustand Store**: Centralized state management with localStorage persistence
- **Real-time Updates**: All dashboards automatically reflect state changes
- **Role-based Access**: Different user roles see relevant data

### User Roles
1. **Importer**: Creates LCs and manages trade operations
2. **Exporter**: Submits required documents for LCs
3. **Admin**: Reviews and approves LCs, pushes to blockchain
4. **Shipment Provider**: Manages shipment logistics and tracking

## Complete LC Flow

### 1. LC Creation (Importer)
```
Importer fills LC form → LC draft generated → Status: "CREATED"
```

**Components:**
- `components/importer-dashboard/lc-form.tsx` - LC creation form
- `components/importer-dashboard/importer-dashboard.tsx` - Importer dashboard

**Features:**
- Comprehensive LC form with validation
- PDF generation for LC draft
- Integration with Zustand store
- Real-time status updates

### 2. Document Submission (Exporter)
```
Exporter uploads documents → Documents submitted → Status: "AWAITING_ADMIN_REVIEW"
```

**Components:**
- `components/exporter-dashboard/document-upload.tsx` - Document upload interface
- `components/exporter-dashboard/exporter-dashboard.tsx` - Exporter dashboard

**Features:**
- Drag & drop file upload
- Document type categorization
- File validation and preview
- Integration with LC workflow

### 3. Admin Review & Approval
```
Admin reviews documents → Approves LC → Pushes to blockchain → Status: "ONCHAIN"
```

**Components:**
- `components/admin-dashboard/admin-dashboard.tsx` - Admin dashboard

**Features:**
- Document review interface
- LC approval workflow
- Blockchain integration simulation
- ZIP download of all documents

### 4. Shipment Management
```
Shipment provider takes over → Updates status → Tracks progress → Status: "SHIPMENT_COMPLETED"
```

**Components:**
- `components/shipment-dashboard/shipment-dashboard.tsx` - Shipment dashboard

**Features:**
- Shipment status updates
- Progress tracking
- Real-time notifications
- Integration with LC lifecycle

## State Management Implementation

### Store Structure (`lib/store.ts`)

```typescript
interface LCStore {
  // State
  lcs: LC[]
  notifications: Notification[]
  currentUser: string
  userRole: 'IMPORTER' | 'EXPORTER' | 'ADMIN' | 'SHIPMENT_PROVIDER'

  // Actions
  createLC: (formData: LCFormData, userId: string) => LC
  submitExporterDocs: (lcId: string, documents: Document[], userId: string) => void
  approveLC: (lcId: string, adminId: string, onchainData: OnchainData) => void
  updateShipmentStatus: (lcId: string, status: ShipmentStatus['status'], provider: string, notes?: string) => void
  
  // Computed
  getLCById: (id: string) => LC | undefined
  getLCsByStatus: (status: LC['status']) => LC[]
  getLCsByUser: (userId: string) => LC[]
}
```

### LC Status Flow

```
CREATED → AWAITING_EXPORTER_DOCS → AWAITING_ADMIN_REVIEW → ONCHAIN → SHIPMENT_INITIATED → SHIPMENT_IN_TRANSIT → SHIPMENT_COMPLETED
```

### Data Persistence

- **localStorage**: Automatic persistence of all state changes
- **Session Management**: User roles and current user maintained across sessions
- **Real-time Sync**: All dashboards reflect changes immediately

## Key Features

### 1. Real-time State Synchronization
- All dashboards subscribe to the same Zustand store
- Changes in one dashboard immediately reflect in others
- No page refresh required for updates

### 2. Role-based Access Control
- Each dashboard shows only relevant data for the user role
- Automatic role switching for demo purposes
- Secure data access patterns

### 3. Document Management
- Support for multiple document types (Invoice, BOL, Insurance, etc.)
- File upload with validation
- Document categorization and metadata
- ZIP download functionality

### 4. Blockchain Integration
- Simulated Avalanche blockchain integration
- Transaction hash and block number tracking
- On-chain status verification

### 5. Shipment Tracking
- Real-time shipment status updates
- Progress tracking with timestamps
- Integration with LC lifecycle

## Demo System

### Demo Page (`app/demo/page.tsx`)
- **Interactive Demo**: Step-by-step LC lifecycle demonstration
- **Real-time Progress**: Visual progress tracking through all steps
- **Dashboard Access**: Direct links to all user dashboards
- **State Monitoring**: Real-time view of application state

### Demo Flow
1. **Importer Creates LC**: Form submission and LC creation
2. **Exporter Submits Documents**: Document upload and submission
3. **Admin Reviews & Approves**: Document review and blockchain push
4. **LC Goes On-chain**: Blockchain integration simulation
5. **Shipment Provider Takes Over**: Logistics management
6. **Shipment Completed**: Full lifecycle completion

```

## Getting Started

### 1. Run the Demo
```bash
npm run dev
# Navigate to /demo
# Click "Start Demo" to see the complete flow
```

### 2. Access Different Dashboards
- **Importer**: `/importer-dashboard`
- **Exporter**: `/exporter-dashboard`
- **Admin**: `/admin-dashboard`
- **Shipment**: `/shipment-dashboard`

### 3. Follow the LC Lifecycle
1. Create an LC as an importer
2. Submit documents as an exporter
3. Review and approve as admin
4. Track shipment as shipment provider

## Technical Implementation Details

### Zustand Store Configuration
```typescript
export const useLCStore = create<LCStore>()(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      // Store implementation
    }),
    {
      name: 'lc-store',
      partialize: (state) => ({
        lcs: state.lcs,
        notifications: state.notifications,
        currentUser: state.currentUser,
        userRole: state.userRole
      })
    }
  )
)
```

### State Updates Pattern
```typescript
// Example: Updating LC status
set((state) => ({
  lcs: state.lcs.map(lc => 
    lc.id === lcId 
      ? { ...lc, status: newStatus, updatedAt: new Date() }
      : lc
  )
}))
```

### Real-time Notifications
```typescript
// Automatic notification creation on state changes
notifications: [
  ...state.notifications,
  {
    id: `notif-${Date.now()}`,
    type: 'LC_CREATED',
    title: 'New LC Created',
    message: `Letter of Credit ${newLC.reference} has been created successfully.`,
    timestamp: new Date(),
    read: false,
    lcId: newLC.id
  }
